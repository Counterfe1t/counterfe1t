## Hello, world! 👋🏻🌍

My name is Karol and I'm a software engineer. This page will help you get to know me a little better:

-   🛠️ I’m currently working on a couple of pet projects most of which you will find here.
-   🌱 I’m currently learning about software architecture and domain-driven design.
-   🎓 I have an engineer's degree in computer science.
-   🎵 Music plays a major part in my life. For that reason I picked up playing the guitar! 🎸🤟🏻
-   🧙🏻 And last but certainly not least: I'm a huge nerd! I absolutely love fantasy & role-playing games!
